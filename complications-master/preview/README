This directory should contain any pre-release libraries needed for
this Early Access build.

If a m2repository directory is provided, it will contain a maven
structure which includes versioned library artifacts within it. To
depend on these libraries, first update the top level gradle build
file in your project to detect this maven repository by adding the
maven block as shown in the following, updating the relative path as
necessary:

allprojects {
    repositories {

        maven {
            /* Reference the preview maven repository location */
            url new File(rootDir, "./preview/libs/m2repository")
        }

        jcenter()
    }
}

You can then add dependencies to the pre-release libraries like normal
in gradle dependency blocks.
